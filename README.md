# 🛡 FULL DNS BLOCK 🛡

This script is designed for users who want full control over their network security and privacy. It automatically fetches and combines various publicly available DNS blocklists to create a balanced yet effective list that blocks unwanted domains, including ads, trackers, malware, and phishing sites.
Perfect for users who want to take full ownership of their network protection 🔒💻
# ⚠️ Important ⚠️
This script does not create its own blocklists. Instead, it relies on publicly available lists maintained by external authors.
**All rights to these lists belong to their respective creators**❗
This script simply automates their retrieval and merging to enhance aggressiveness while reducing the final file size for practical use.
